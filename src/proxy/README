The code have been tested with Python 2.5.2

To run, type 'python __init__.py'.

1. General information about the scripts

    1.1 __init__.py

	The purpose of this init script is to easily set up and
	configure a test environment for the Proxy. All global variables
	and instances will be configured here.

    1.2 banhandler.py

	The abstraction layer for the MySQL banlist database for the
	Proxy. The module contains all functions needed to manipulate
	the database.

    1.3 event.py
	
	Holds the type and handler function for IRC events.

    1.4 incomingconnections.py

	Handles incoming connections and traffic.

    1.5 ircparse.py

	Will take a connection, read data from the socket and return an
	event.

    1.6 orc.conf

	The configuration file for ORC.

    1.7 orcbot.py

	The IRC bot that serves as the communication medium between the
	Proxy and the user.

    1.8 serverconnectiondaemon.py

	Opens connections to IRC servers and polls for events on the
	socket object.

    1.9 validated_users.py

	An object to hold the connections for users who are currently
	connected, and whose pseudonyms have been validated.

2. Prerequisites

    2.1 Install Python IRC Library

	This library is intended to encapsulate the IRC protocol. The
	library is available in both Debian and Ubuntu as python-irclib.
	You can also download it from
	http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/.

    2.2 Install MySQLdb

	MySQLdb is an interface to the popular MySQL database server for
	Python. The module is available in both Debian and Ubuntu as
	python-mysqldb. You can also download it from
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/.

    2.3 Install GnuPGInterface

	GnuPGInterface is a Python module for GnuPG. The module is
	available in both Debian and Ubuntu as python-gnupginterface.
	You can also download it from http://py-gnupg.sourceforge.net/.

    2.4 Create a GPG key

	If you do not have a GPG key, you will need to create one in
	order for orcbot.py to validate the signed pseudonym. See
	Section 1 in the HOWTO for the Pseudonym Manager for more
	information.

    2.5 Install MySQL

	MySQL is a database management system. The software is available
	from the package management system in both Debian and Ubuntu.
	You can also download MySQL from
	http://www.mysql.com/downloads/. Once the software is installed,
	you can create a database with a descriptive name (for example
	"bandb"), as well as a username and a password.

3. Configuration

    3.1 Set up the banlist table

	Log in to the database, and create the following table:
	
	CREATE TABLE `bandb` (
	  `banid` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	  `timestamp` timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	  `duration_mins` int(11) NOT NULL,
	  `pseudonym` varchar(50) collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
	  `network` varchar(30) collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
	  `channel` varchar(30) collate utf8_unicode_ci default NULL,
	  `serverban` tinyint(1) NOT NULL default '0',
	  PRIMARY KEY  (`banid`)
	) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci;
	
    3.2 Configure orc.conf	

	Configure the orc.conf file with the information relevant to
	your setup. Some default values have been provided.
