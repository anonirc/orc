This is a set of scripts that shows a user a CAPTCHA and, upon entering
the correct set of letters, returns the output of a file that is signed
with GPG and contains a random string.

The scripts have been tested with Python 2.5.5.

CaptchasDotNet:

    This is a Python module for easy utilization of http://captchas.net.

gpgsign:

    Creates a file with a random string, signs the file using 'gpg
    --clearsign' and then saves the output in the original file.

show_captcha:

    This script will simply show a user a CAPTCHA.

verify_captcha:

   This script will verify the string entered by the user. If the right
   CAPTCHA has been entered, the script will run gpgsign.py and then
   return the output of the signed file to the user.

Before configuring the scripts, you will need to do the following:

    - Enable cgi in Apache
    - Register on https://captchas.net to obtain your own secret key
    - Install python-gnupginterface
    - Generate a GPG key pair if you haven't done so already

To configure the scripts:

gpgsign:

   - Set the name of the file you wish to write the random string to
   - Set the location of the .gnupg directory
   - Set the secret passphrase of the GPG key

show_captcha:

    - Rename from .py to .cgi
    - Set the correct values for 'client' and 'secret'

verify_captcha:

    - Rename from .py to .cgi
    - Set the correct values for 'client' and 'secret'
    - Set the path to gpgsign.py

The four scripts, and the .gnupg directory, need to be owned by the
Apache user (usually www-data). In addition to that, the four scripts
need to have the execute bit set.
